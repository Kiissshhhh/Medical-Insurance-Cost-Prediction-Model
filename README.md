## Description
This project aims to predict medical insurance costs using machine learning techniques, specifically leveraging linear regression. The model provides insights into the factors affecting insurance premiums, helping stakeholders understand and anticipate costs more effectively.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis to identify key features that influence medical insurance costs, including age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking status.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales features to improve model performance.
- **Linear Regression Model**: Utilizes a linear regression algorithm to predict insurance costs based on input features.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses the model's performance using metrics like R² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations to interpret the model's predictions and feature importance.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains information about various individuals' medical insurance costs and their characteristics. You can find the dataset [here](link-to-your-dataset-if-available) or you can use a similar dataset like the [Medical Cost Personal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance).

## Model
The model is built using a linear regression algorithm, which predicts the insurance costs based on the input features. The following features are utilized in the model:
- Age
- Sex
- BMI
- Number of children
- Smoker status
- Region

## Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **R² Score**: Indicates the proportion of the variance for the dependent variable that's explained by the independent variables.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errors, indicating how close the predicted values are to the actual values.
